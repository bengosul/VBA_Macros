AutoFill shortcut

For lack of an AutoFill shortcut in Excel, I assigned Ctrl+Shift+Q to this macro, as an alternative to clicking the AutoFill solid cross. 
It uses default fill if more than one row is selected, to use for dates, increments etc, otherwise AutoFill copy mode is used.
The AutoFill won't stop until reaching the last row, i.e. if there are gaps in the column to use teh AutoFill along.
Will cohose the longest column between adjacent left and right.
